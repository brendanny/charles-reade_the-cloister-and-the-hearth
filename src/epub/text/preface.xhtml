			<h2>PREFACE</h2>
			<p>A small portion of this tale appeared in <i>Once a Week</i>, Julyâ€”September, 1859, under the title of "A Good Fight."</p>
			<p>After writing it, I took wider views of the subject, and also felt uneasy at having deviated <i>unnecessarily</i> from the historical outline of a true story. These two sentiments have cost me more than a year's very hard labour, which I venture to think has not been wasted. After this plain statement I trust all who comment on this work will see that, to describe it as a reprint, would be unfair to the public and to me. The English language is copious and, in any true man's hands, quite able to convey the truth; namely, that one fifth of the present work is a reprint, and four fifths of it a new composition.</p>
